2011-10-27 15:52:14	avandenhoven	I need a quick hand with bundler. I'm writing a little utility (that I'll share with my team) that I'm trying to test. When I run the script from the directory I'm writing it in, I don't really have a problem. But if I run it from the directory where its supposed to be called from, I'm getting 'default_gemfile': Could not locate Gemfile
2011-10-27 15:52:55	avandenhoven	What is the right way to use bundler for this sort of situation?

2011-10-27 16:18:16	avandenhoven	the problem I have with that, but maybe i have to get over myself, is that the script is going to do things to a directory, ideally the current directory (which makes testing in the way you suggest awkward)

2011-10-27 18:20:59	marcamilly	if I want to specify that a method accepts an optional argument 'type', would I simply declare it like so:

2011-10-27 18:21:19	marcamilly	as in, if I declare it like that, does that make it optional? i.e. someone can pass in type or not

2011-11-12 13:54:11	envygeeks	Debian experimental for the most part is stable unless it's a major feature change that's why they pass it down the line, for example GNOME3 in Experimental is actually really really really really really broken and unstable because it's still being  tested and patched, but things like Ruby which you generally don't patch you just take upstream with quilt and compile it into a binary it's only there to see if there are any possible

2011-11-12 14:25:27	indeterminate	my main gripe about the config/make cycle is that there wasn't a really obvious way to undo it unless you kept some of the files around and were ready to do the make uninstall/clean thing (if it was provided by the package author)

2011-11-12 14:50:42	indeterminate	what's the average age for #ruby?
2011-11-12 14:50:43	RubyPanther	It is one of the major views, this is not a personal thing of mine. It is just a fact that lots of people believe this. Not just for Ruby but all through the distro. How are things packaged, according to upstream or according to somebody at the distro in a management role?
2011-11-12 14:50:55	shevy	indeterminate no idea ... I'd guess .... 26!
2011-11-12 14:51:05	indeterminate	a hair above average, then ;p
2011-11-12 14:51:19	shevy	RubyPanther is totally pulling the channel into the +40 range
2011-11-12 14:51:29	indeterminate	doubt it. look through the image directory

2011-11-12 14:51:42	envygeeks	Description-en: Ruby 1.9.1 full installation. For many good reasons, the Ruby programming language is split in many small different packages. Installing this package will make sure you have all the packages that add up to a full Ruby installation, with the exception of the Tcl/Tk bindings for Ruby, which are only recommended.
2011-11-12 14:52:06	RubyPanther	There is a picture in there of me at 22 and another at 35
2011-11-12 14:52:09	shevy	For many good reasons!!!
2011-11-12 14:52:16	RubyPanther	34
2011-11-12 14:52:39	envygeeks	shevy: AKA installing some gems could break the system so leave it as a seperate package if they can install it as a  gem so they can chose which  they want
2011-11-12 14:52:49	shevy	wait
2011-11-12 14:52:52	shevy	you say *can* choose
2011-11-12 14:52:58	shevy	but I understand it that they *must* choose
2011-11-12 14:53:11	envygeeks	no, because you can do apt-get install ruby-full ;)
2011-11-12 14:53:26	envygeeks	ruby-full will include everything that Ruby recommends
2011-11-12 14:53:38	shevy	i remember that... first thing on debian-based systems I do is usually apt-get install build essentials (or whatever was that command again)
2011-11-12 14:53:43	RubyPanther	the existence of any one current distro doesn't refute traditional BOFH views.
2011-11-12 14:53:52	RubyPanther	distro [package]

2011-11-12 14:56:01	envygeeks	No you are assuming, most sysadmins are lazy, Debian sysadmins are minimal, we only want what we want, I don't care what the authors want me to want, if I was going to compile bind myself I would remove half the shit it includes as well, luckily debian allows me to be selective about what I install and when
2011-11-12 14:56:17	envygeeks	and lazy is subjective because by lazy I mean they have lots to do so it's easier to use Redhat
