2011-11-12 13:54:07	Whiskers	It depends, if you're going 50 in a 30-zone then it's considered somewhat serious.
2011-11-12 13:54:22	Whiskers	Most 30-zones are streets kids play in

2011-11-12 14:58:11	Whiskers	lucy_c: During the viking era, scandinavian vikings loves to pillage the shit out of england, so they often did so. After they've won the battle they started pillaging, and a lot of the girls were taken as slaves. Of course, only the hot ones. And, a lot of these slaves got raped, some actually fell in love with the vikings. Anyhow, norway and sweden then got pretty girls from england to mix with, making for better and more beautiful genes.
