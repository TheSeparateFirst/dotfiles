2011-10-26 15:05:07	fauxsoup	Hey folks. I've been dealing with this issue all day, trying to get a server up and running. The server in question needs to be able to accept requests, perform some complex operations, and send back a response. What server doesn't? I've effectively separated this into two applications: inets with mod_esi and my own app, for performing those complex operations.
2011-10-26 15:09:03	fauxsoup	My app is structured as a supervised gen_server which spawns handlers (gen_fsm) for each incoming request. I receive the requests from mod_esi via a gen_server call into my server (obfuscated behind an exported function). I spawn_link a new worker process with the from parameter in its state (used as a unique identifier for the request). The mod_esi piece then starts a receive to wait for its response.

2011-10-26 15:10:14	fauxsoup	gen_fsm finishes what it's doing and calls back to the server, which sends the response back to mod_esi via a generic message (which my mod_esi script is expecting).
2011-10-26 15:11:10	fauxsoup	This all works fine under normal conditions. However, when I start handling a large number of simultaneous requests, the server gradually slows down its response and ultimately crashes (and is rescued by the supervisor).
2011-10-26 15:11:39	fauxsoup	The error report I get about the crash indicates this: exception exit timeout gen_server:call
2011-10-26 15:12:04	fauxsoup	I don't use timeouts in the gen_server at all, so this is entirely unexpected.
2011-10-26 15:12:27	klaar	the default timeout for calls is 5 seconds
2011-10-26 15:12:39	fauxsoup	Not infinity?
2011-10-26 15:12:46	klaar	no, 5 seconds
2011-10-26 15:13:19	p_l	infinity would be a bad choice
2011-10-26 15:13:24	fauxsoup	Undoubtedly
2011-10-26 15:13:53	fauxsoup	That being said, how can I structure my application to avoid this issue? I have one gen_server handling all the incoming requests to my application: is this a bad choice?
2011-10-26 15:14:28	rvirding	how many requests and how much work has to be done for each
2011-10-26 15:14:44	rvirding	does everything pass through the server?
2011-10-26 15:15:04	fauxsoup	Well over 1000 requests per second, and it's not a significant amount of work (all the ACTUAL work is done in a spawned worker process).
2011-10-26 15:15:32	fauxsoup	All incoming requests pass through the server. When the workers are done, they notify the server, which sends the response back to the Process that generated the request

2011-10-26 15:15:57	p_l	hmmm... wasn't it possible to associate the new process with accepted socket?
2011-10-26 15:16:04	rvirding	that would mean that a request could take a long time
2011-10-26 15:16:33	fauxsoup	I could associate it directly with the mod_esi pid, and avoid the hit to the server on the response
2011-10-26 15:17:21	fauxsoup	Requests when under normal load take less than 50ms
2011-10-26 15:17:28	rvirding	is the server just starting a worker and then waiting for the reply to send to the client?

2011-10-26 15:21:30	rvirding	is it the timeout on the call it does to the worker?
2011-10-26 15:21:51	rvirding	there is a default 5sec timeout on gen_server:call
2011-10-26 15:22:09	fauxsoup	It times out on the worker's gen_server:call to post the response
2011-10-26 15:22:26	fauxsoup	It may time out the other way, too, but I haven't seen that one happen
2011-10-26 15:23:38	rvirding	ok, so the worker does a gen_server call to the server to send back the reply?
2011-10-26 15:23:49	fauxsoup	Yes
2011-10-26 15:24:28	fauxsoup	I guess I can try having the worker send the response directly; that should cut the load on the server in half
2011-10-26 15:24:33	rvirding	could it be the client which times out waiting for a reply from the server?
2011-10-26 15:24:52	rvirding	yes or have it do a gen_server:cast
2011-10-26 15:25:18	rvirding	you have your own protocol between client and server don't you?
2011-10-26 15:25:20	fauxsoup	As in the mod_esi waiting? Negative. I have that sitting in a receive with no timeout specified
2011-10-26 15:25:48	rvirding	if so it would be easy for the worker to respond directly
2011-10-26 15:26:11	fauxsoup	Okay, I'll give that a try.
2011-10-26 15:27:22	fauxsoup	Just for sanity sake, so I can maybe throttle my sysadmin: 1000 to 2000 HTTP requests per second on an eight core machine. Does that sound feasible, with minimal actual work being done?
2011-10-26 15:27:23	rvirding	or try doing a cast first and see if that helps or just delays the problem
2011-10-26 15:27:33	fauxsoup	What's the distinction between cast and call?
2011-10-26 15:27:50	rvirding	call is synchronous, cast asynchronous
2011-10-26 15:28:02	fauxsoup	That's what I thought, but both are technically blocking calls.
