2011-11-12 13:26:25	Delahunt	i prefer aes-cbc-essiv:sha256 at bit strength 128, which is a lot easier for a minimal computer like say a netbook to handle

2011-11-12 13:28:44	Delahunt	for a computer to do aes-cbc-essiv 128 bit isn't hard, it doesn't slow you down much but is still enough security that unless they're the FBI or MacGyver, they're not getting your info
2011-11-12 13:28:51	miniuser	my stuff is all from the internetz anyways ...

2011-11-12 16:40:30	terabit	whatever killed those sectors might go on and kill the whole disk(speaking from experience)
2011-11-12 16:40:43	hjax	i keep everything important on a flash drive
2011-11-12 16:40:46	terabit	oh,thent that's no biggie
2011-11-12 16:40:53	terabit	thought it was like 2TB

2011-11-12 16:42:48	terabit	hjax: what laptop is that ?
2011-11-12 16:42:49	Guizmo	why a disk so big ? 500 GB is far enough and less a headach when you need to backup it when it is full
2011-11-12 16:43:17	terabit	Guizmo: my 1TB got full too fast :(

2011-11-12 17:11:39	tacit	john_rambo: Create a partition of type 0x07 and create an NTFS using "mkfs.ntfs". Creating that in Windows is preferred, however.

2011-11-12 17:13:09	Guizmo	the normal version of 11.4 is factory or final ?

2011-11-12 17:14:16	Guizmo	yes
2011-11-12 17:14:20	john_rambo	tacit, You are asking to create the partition via YAST? I once made a mess trying to do that ....Not posssible via Gparted ?
2011-11-12 17:14:32	tacit	Guizmo: openSUSE 11.4 has been released 8 months ago. Factory, which is how we call the current development version, has since moved on and has now become 12.1 which is due to be released next week. Factory in fact, is already moving on. So 11.4 is final and released. 12.1 has already gone gold, and factory is always moving.
2011-11-12 17:14:38	sjraarke	Guizmo: That's the release version
2011-11-12 17:14:53	Guizmo	ok then factory it is , thanks
2011-11-12 17:15:06	Guizmo	err final..

2011-11-12 17:15:21	tacit	john_rambo: I believe that you can create all kinds of partition types with gparted. You may not be able to create file systems at the same time as gparted likes to do.
2011-11-12 17:15:25	sjraarke	Guizmo: Factory is not advised for a production system tho
2011-11-12 17:15:51	Guizmo	yes I read too fast, I corrected to final

2011-11-12 17:18:23	tacit	Solaris444: Not yet released.
2011-11-12 17:18:33	Solaris444	It's gone gold tacit.
2011-11-12 17:18:42	tacit	Solaris444: Yes it has.
2011-11-12 17:19:05	Solaris444	ok, because I'm seeing some of my bug reports being updated against 12.1 final
2011-11-12 17:19:10	Solaris444	so clearly some people have it.
2011-11-12 17:20:02	tacit	Solaris444: Some mirrors are configured incorrectly and are serving staged content. The whole thing won't flip until, err Friday?
